>What are the three types of conditional statements?
* The three types of conditional statements are:
  * `if` statements
  * `else if` statements
  * `else` statements

>What are four types of Comparison Operators and how you would use them?
* `==`: the equality operator, which is used to determine whether two values are equal (will convert types)
* `===`: the strict equality operator, which is used to determine whether two values are strictly equal (will not convert data types)
* `&&`: logical and operator, used to test whether both things on either side are true
* `!=`: inequality operator (also called bang equal, which would be an awesome superhero name), which checks whether two things are not equal (will convert data types)
