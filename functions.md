>Describe/define DRY and why functions exist.
* DRY stand for Don't Repeat Yourself, and expresses a principle of programming that things must only be represented once within a system, thus avoiding repetition and unnecessarily bloated code.
* Functions operate in support of this principle by allowing the repeated use of the same block of code whenever a particular action is needed. This avoids repeatedly having to write the same bit of code over and over again.

>Describe/define the difference between creating a function and calling/executing a function.
* Creating a function just defines what the intended action is. The function will not operate/execute merely by its definitiion.
* Functions execute when they are called.

>Describe/define what arguments/parameters are and how they relate to functions.
* Parameters are the variables in a function's definition.
* Arguments are the data that are passed into the function's parameters when it's called.

>Describe/define mutating (dirty) vs non-mutating (pure) functions.
* Mutating (also known as "dirty") functions result in the changing of an object or bit of data.
* Non-mutating (also known as "pure") functions do not change the object or bit of data, but instead create a new object or data structure that reflects the changes worked by the function.
