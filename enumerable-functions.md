>Describe a map method.
* The map() method iterates a function on the elements of an array and uses the results to create a new array. Map() does not change the original array.

>Describe a filter method.
* Filter method iterates over each item in an array and checks to see if a condition is `true`. If the condition is `false` for a particular item, that item is removed.

>What is the difference between the map() and the filter() function?
* The map() function can iterate any function over each item in the array, whereas the filter() method checks whether a particular condition is true for each item in the array.
* Map() does not change the original array, whereas filter() does change the original array by removing those elments for which the condition is `false`.
