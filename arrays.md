>Describe an array.
* An array is an object containing multiple elements. It is a means of storing information in an indexed list of stuff.

>In JavaScript can you have a single array with a String and a Number in it?
* Yes. Because JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, you could even have all seven data types in the same array.

>In JavaScript do arrays start at index 0 or index 1?
* JavaScript uses zero indexing, which means that arrays start with their first item at position `0`.
