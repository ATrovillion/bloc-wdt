>What is recursion?
* Recursion refers to the quality of a function that calls and works on itself repeatedly until some requirement is met.

>When would a programmer want to write a recursive function instead of an iterative one?
* A recursive function should be used where the complexity of an iterative function would be so high as to be impracticable. Though recursive functions tend to be more space inefficient in their expression than iterative functions, they do tend to be easier to express.

>What is a base case and what is its role in a recursive function?
* The base case is the requirement that breaks the chain of recursion. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the "terminating case".

>What would happen if a programmer did not utilize a base case within a recursive function?
* The absence of a base case would result in a recursive function repeating itself in an endless loop.
